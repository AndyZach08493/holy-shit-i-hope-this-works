      The C++ source code is organized in three different ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="term"><a href="ByPage/index.html">By Page Numbers</a></li>
      <li class="def">
	These files contain C++ source code taken directly from the
	text.&nbsp; File names end in <tt>.cpp</tt> or <tt>.h</tt>,
	and include the chapter number and the page number on which
	the code begins.&nbsp; This section is organized by chapter;
	each chapter indicates the range of pages it contains.
      </li>
      <li class="term"><a href="ByName/index.html">By Name</a></li>
      <li class="def">
	These files contain C++ header files, implementation files,
	and individual functions that appear in the book.&nbsp; Files
	are organized by chapter.&nbsp; File names end in
	<tt>.cpp</tt> or <tt>.h</tt>, and are consistent with those
	presented in the text.&nbsp; When more than one version of a
	class or function exists in a chapter, the file name includes
	a page number for clarity.
      </li>
      <li class="term">&nbsp;</li>
      <li class="def">
	When a file in this section depends on other files, those
	files are included.&nbsp; The files also contain all of the
	include statements necessary for compilation.&nbsp; For some
	ADTs, you must complete the definitions of constants and types
	before you use them.
      </li>
      <li class="term"><a href="Doxygen/index.html">Doxygen
      Commented</a></li>
      <li class="def">
	This is a set of Web pages, documenting the source code in the
	text, created by the Doxygen documentation system.&nbsp;
	Doxygen is an open-source (<a
	href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>)
	documentation system that can be used to inline document many
	programming languages, including C++.&nbsp; Doxygen is syntax
	compatible with <a
	href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/">JavaDoc</a>, which
	gives students that know JavaDoc, or will be using the Java
	language in future classes, an advantage.&nbsp; Doxygen is a
	cross-platform application, running under Windows, Linux (and
	other Unix variants), and Mac OS X..&nbsp; A copy can be found
	at <a
	href="http://www.doxygen.org/index.html">http://www.doxygen.org/</a>.&nbsp;
