great find, started looking at it and almost had the itch to start coding along right away, pretty awesome when pitt professors actually write the books but unfortunately we don't have him. I like this site, trying to get more and more used to it. So is there a general plan yet of what is going on? C for 449 C++ for 1566 or Objective-C for apps? or even more intensive java stuff?
